## General info
The application allows the user to register for the event, the most important factor during
registering is the appropriate motivation. During the registration process, the candidate can 
choose whether to sign up for lectures and workshops. The role of the administrator is to select 
the most motivated candidates of the event and mark them in the form, the administrator can reject 
the candidate if he or she doesn't show willingness to participate in the project.
The administrator can also download the candidates data directly to the .csv files.
The project was created during the Corealate course.
